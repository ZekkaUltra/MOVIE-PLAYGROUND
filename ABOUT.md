This project is an app that can search for any of our favorites movies, it is linked with "omdb API"(a movie API), and let you search 
about any movie present in this API.
The app is created with REACT and HOOKS, it's a simple app with few components, just 4 components:
-App.js
-Header.js
-Movie.js
-Search.js
Basically, we use a form to register the query and we search through the API for queries similar to the one typed in, then we render all 
datas with any similarities with the query.
But I let you test the app to see by yourself.
